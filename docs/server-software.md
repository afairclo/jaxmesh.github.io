# Server Software



For software tools developed specifically for meshtastic but probably require running for yourself or your local mesh. Typically hosted on a server. You probably don't need to know how to run it, to use it.

- [Meshview by pablorevilla](https://github.com/pablorevilla-meshtastic/meshview) - A project watches a MQTT topic for meshtastic messages, imports them to a database and has a web UI to view them. [Example on BayMesh](https://meshview.bayme.sh/)
- [Meshinfo by kevinelliott](https://github.com/kevinelliott/meshinfo) - A project written in Python and connects to an MQTT server that is receiving Meshtastic messages for the purpose of visualizing and inspecting traffic. [Example on SacValleyMesh](https://svm.meshinfo.network/mqtt_log.html)
- [bayme.sh-bot by ppicazo](https://github.com/ppicazo/bayme.sh-bot) - An MQTT to Discord logger bot for local meshes.
